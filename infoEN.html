      <h1>Hello there!</h1><br>
      <p>My name is Lia and I am a student of <a id="school" href="https://codeberryschool.com/hu/" target="_blank">Codeberry Programming School</a>. <br>I was born in Tata, got my degree at Communication and Media Studies at the University of Pécs, and my current hometown is Veszprém.</p>
      <p>After the university I tried myself out in different kinds of jobs, even in some which were completely different from my previous education, but none of them felt comfortable and satisfying enough for me.</p>
      <p>The current state of the world has given me an opportunity to think about my life, about what do I really want to do for a living and that is how I turned to programming. Even as a child I was interested in computers, I wanted to understand the way they function but the events of my life always took me away from this direction. However according to what I have learned so far at Codeberry I feel that I finally found my way and I will do everything that I can to stay on this road as long as possible.</p>
      <p>In my freetime I prefer playing on my PC, mostly World of Warcraft, also I have a dog who often demands my attention all day long. My bucket list includes only one thing so far and that is to visit every zoo in Hungary.</p>
